### Kps App Interface/Functionality Description
```
   * Important: Overlay does not work on most applications where fullscreen mode is enabled!!
   * Graph button shows you the Kps-Time Graph that you've been yearning to analyse with
   * Freeze Button freezes graph
   * Play/Break button changes the horizontal scale of the graph to accomodate longer gameplay tracking!
   * 7 key/4 key button changes mode
   * Config button allows you to customise your own keybinds which you want to track!

```

## Further App UI Customisation

  * Restart the App!
  * **Removing these images will prompt the program to use its default option instead**
